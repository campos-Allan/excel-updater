## Disclaimer
Itâ€™s not possible to share the files and info's that this script was using it, and I scrambled the variable names and other stuff to make it anonymous, might made some mistakes in this step.

## Structure
Basically using 'win32com.client' tools to get values from a spreadsheet (planned data), and then updating queries in a second spreadsheet to generate data for cross referencing.

## Approach
I created this code for a tedious process of opening a spreadsheet, updating the queries in it, retrieving scrambled data from a "realized" sheet, and cross-referencing it with "planned" data from other spreadsheets in a sheet that showed the final result of this data cross-checking.
